# PC-Guard-Remover

## Welcome!
Cannot delete the "PC Guard" program? Try this.

## PC Guard?
PC Guard is a program designed to stop users from visiting banned websites or downloading/playing games.

Annoying, huh?

You can't even just delete it; You'll need a password for it(which is probably hidden, only the admin of your PC might know).

## How to use
Download this whole repository and unzip the .zip file.

Find *main.exe*, right-click on it, and click *"Run as administrator"*.

You have to restart your PC after the execution.(Your PC will automatically be restarted after the execution)

## How do I delete this program?
Well, this, PC Guard, is also a computer program.

However, the program folder is hidden, and even if you find the location, you cannot just access the "private" folder(which contains the main .exe files and the .sys files).

That's why this program is here!
